                <p>
                    United Technical College, College of Engineering, popularly known as (U-TEC), was established in 2008 (2065 BS) under private sector initiative. The foundation of U-TEC was instigated by a group of farsighted professionals and academicians who comprehended
                    the need of a college for offering the technical education outside the valley. Mostly, the university level engineering education in private sector was concentrated in the capital only. Therefore, for reaching a wider section of Nepali
                    youth outside the valley and making the quality technical education accessible and affordable to the poor and deprived youths in outer region, it was essential to establish technical colleges outside the capital, which U-TEC did by
                    establishing the first private engineering college in Chitwan. Since its establishment, the youths from outside the valley region have taken full advantage and are continually enrolling in different engineering disciplines offered
                    by the college. Since the establishment the college has produced six batches of undergraduate engineers so far in Civil Engineering and three in Electrical & Electronics Engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The facility at U-TEC is located in Bharatpur Metropolitan City, Ward No.-11, Bhojad, U-TEC Chowk, Chitwan. It has physical and institutional resources built on 20 Ropanies (1.0 ha) of land. These resources essentially cateres to the academic needs in
                    the bachelor level programs. The full-time Bachelor of Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering and Electrical & Electronics Engineering degree offered by U-TEC, affiliated to Pokhara University, builds skill, expertise, and knowledge
                    among its graduates in the area of higher technology and design. The industry driven project works, research and development and learning outlined by the university is followed strictly to enhance the academic quality. So, UTEC provides
                    unconditional opportunities for graduates to pursue engineering education with passion and confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to above, U-TEC has gained opportunity in achieving its centre of excellence in education as Pokhara University granted affiliation from, March 2018, (i.e. Falgun 2074 BS) for running graduate course leading to M.Sc. (Master of Science) degree
                    in Construction Management (CM) at the same facility. Presently, third batch of graduate students in CM are enrolled and courses are running smoothly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    U-TEC is headed by the Executive Chairman, who is responsible for overall planning, administration and management and is providing leadership in planning, designing and implementing new programs. All the academic matters are entrusted to principal and
                    academic director, who will be responsible for overall academic matters and will provide leadership for planning and enhancing the academic quality. However, individual programs are coordinated by department heads and program coordinators
                    designed for different program areas.

                <p>
                    Rapid changes in the physical infrastructure development and construction technology have demanded the highly specialized human resources to organize and manage the infrastructure construction works. In addition to this, construction activities, both
                    in public and private sectors, are not only increasing but also becoming complex. Because of this, there is a great demand for qualified and competent Construction Managers in the country and abroad. Therefore, MSc. Construction Management
                    program at U-TEC has been ongoing in affiliation to Pokhara University, which intends to produce managers capable of using state of art, knowledge and skills in organizing and managing the construction works
